# Todo app

This project was created to get familiar with React.

## Why

As a backend developer I felt I was missing out on the frontend side of things. So that's why.

## How

You can check out which tools I used by visiting the `/settings` page.\
Something you won't find here: the app is deployed through Vercel.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This will install all the dependencies.

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
